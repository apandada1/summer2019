An outline of the topics considered is provided in the contents list below. Following the presentation of topics 1-3, which are of a general nature, they discuss two kinds of nonclassical light: quadrature-squeezed light (topics 4-6) and photon-number-squeezed light (topics 7-9). In the last part of the article they provide a listing of early nonclassical light experiments and consider a number of applications (and potential applications) of squeezed light. Finally, they provide a survey of the available general literature.}
